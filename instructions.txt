Files description

	src/velocities.cpp: node in which we calculate the robot velocities starting from wheels' RPM encoders
						we used this node in the early stages and for comparison purposes
	src/velocitiesTicks: node in which we calculate the robot velocities starting from wheels' ticks encoders, it subscibes
						 to /wheel_states and feeds the odometry node through messages sent on the /cmd_vel topic
	src/odometry: the node in which the odometry is computed, either with Euler method or Runge-Kutta method, for then
				  publishing the result on the topic /odom
		    	  it offers a reset service to set a new pose for the robot and a dynamic parameter to change integration method
	src/tfBroadcast: this node is used to define the robot transformation frames, specifically the world frame,
					 the odometry frame and the robot frame (base_link)
					 It also implements the broadcast messages from world to odometry frame and from odometry to base_link frame
	src/wheelsVel: read from topic /cmd_vel and calculates back the wheels velocities from the robot velocities,
				   publishes results with messages of custom type sent on the /wheels_rpm topic in rad/s
	src/checkParams : a node in which we tried to calculate the optimal robot parameters starting from the ground truth and
					  the wheel velocities. We ended up discarding this method (the node in not included in the launch file)
					  since there isn't enough correlation between the two measuraments to obtain precise numbers.

	cfg/parameters.cfg : dynamic reconfigure of param "set_method" to change integration method, 0 (default) for Euler, 1 for RK
	cfg/robotparameters.cfg : dynamic rec of the robot parameters to perform calibration without recompiling
	srv/ResetPose.srv : service to set a new pose for the robot (x y theta)
	msg/WheelsVel.msg : custom message to broadcast wheels' rpm values on topic /wheels_rpm
	launch/project_1.launch : launch file, the static params are all set here


Parameters description
	
	static params (all set in the launch file)	
		
		gearRatio : self explanatory		
		use_sim_time : param that tells rqt_plot that we are using a bag recording
		msgInterval : parameter we used to check if, by computing the odometry every few messages
		      	      instead of every single message, the noise would be improved.
		      	      In our testing we didn't see a big difference so we set it to 1 by default
		wheelRadius : radius in meters
		halfLength : wheel position along x (l) in meters
		halfWidth : wheel position along y (w) in meters
		tickRes : encoders resolution (N counts per revolution)
	NOTE: robot parameters (radius, length, width and resolution) are also dynamically reconfigurable, changing the
		  values in the node velocitiesTicks. Once calibration was finished we changed the default values in the launch
		  file as well, so that every other node could read the updated values.
	
	dynamic params
	"rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure" to change them
		set_method : change integration method, 0 (default) for Euler, 1 for RK		     
		

Structure of the TF tree

	world -> odom -> base_link


Structure of custom messages
	
	project_1::WheelsVel
		Header header
		float64 rpm_fl
		float64 rpm_fr
		float64 rpm_rl
		float64 rpm_rr
	NOTE: in the project specification the order requested is fl-fr-rr-rl, however we used this
	      convention in order to be consistent with the one used in the bags provided.


How to start and use the nodes

	our package is called "project_1"
	to start the nodes "roslaunch project_1 project_1.launch"
	to change the integration method "rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure" and switch "set_method" to desired value
	to set a new pose "rosservice call /resetPose x y theta"
	to use rviz, set the fixed frame to "world"
	

Additional infos
	To perform paramaters calibration, we changed each value one at a time using rqt_reconfigure and observed the effects
	on rqt_graph and rviz. After each bag, we would call the reset service without restarting the nodes or recompiling. Having
	understood the contribution of each parameter on the robot movement, we put everything together and fine tuned them.
	We then updated the default values in the launch file so that other nodes (such as WheelsVel) could use them.
